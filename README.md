# SQL Employee Tracker

## Description

- The motivation to complete this challenge was to test my own skills gained in the most recent week of the coding bootcamp, including but not limited to: Databases & Database management, tables, connecting to Node.js, Schema preparation, Seeds, Keys, Joins and prepared statements.
- This project was built as a testing ground for my own retention of the aforementioned skills.
- This App allows a user to track employees, roles and departments within an organisation, as well as create new entries and update existing ones.
- Through building this application, I learnt that there are many programming skills outside of what we learn throughout the week, and that research and collaboration is critical in order to achieve the best outcome for any given project.
